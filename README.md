#*3D Model of My House – Created in Fusion 360*

### **Overview**

This project contains a detailed 3D model of my house, created using Autodesk Fusion 360. The model was built based on the original 2D construction drawings drafted by a civil engineer. The provided 2D reference image is included for accuracy and for use in other CAD or 3D applications.
All major structural elements were modeled using advanced features in Fusion 360, including *extrude* and *sweep* operations for components such as grills.

### **Use Cases**

* Architectural visualization
* Importing into Blender for rendering/animation
* Further modification in CAD/CAM software
* Structural, mechanical, or interior planning
* Educational use for learning modeling workflows

### **Files Included**

* Fusion 360 3D model
* Reference 2D drawing
* Preview images

### **Notes**

The model is designed to be easily imported into external software. Geometry is clean, organized, and optimized for further editing.
